# Cinema Website
A movie and series browsing website built with NextJS, TailwindCSS, Redux, React-Slick Carousel and OMDb API. 

The website uses OMDb to pull movie and series data from IMDb into a Redux store which is then displayed on the page.

# Lessons Learned
Redux has a reputation for not being optimal in smaller projects because there is a lot of tedious boilerplate code required to get it working at a base level making it inefficient. I certainly agree with the previous statement. I can imagine that Redux is more useful in larger projects.

# Potential Improvements
1) Dynamic favourites list. A button on each film/series to add them to a list of favourites would add some utility. Until then I have left a static list of some of my favourite films.

2) Link to IMDb page for each film/series. Obviously I can't actually play the relevant video files on my website but linking to the IMDb page would be a valid substitute.

3) Left and Right slider arrows could be more fitting with the theme of the website. Replacing may require using a different slider software.
